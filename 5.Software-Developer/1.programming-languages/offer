Dear Samira,

Thank you for the offer. I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to join Sotoon's team. The challenges the company faces are fascinating, and I love the potential for growth.

Before I fully accept, I'd like to discuss a few important points for clarification to make an informed decision.

    Strategic Alignment: To maximize the impact of my work, I’m eager to gain a deeper insight into Sotoon’s strategic vision and future plans. Would there be an opportunity to discuss the company’s roadmap with the Chief Product Officer or CEO, who are at the helm of these decisions?
    It would also be helpful to know more about our major clients and their primary challenges that my role is expected to address.

    Role Clarity: I'm thrilled by the potential of becoming the CTO. However, I seek clarification for a potential transition plan:
        Is there a projected timeline or conditions for when I might take on the CTO position?
        What performance metrics should I strive for to demonstrate my readiness for the role?

Additionally, While I am enthusiastic about the opportunity at Sotoon, I must mention that my current company has presented a counter-offer, which is financially 20% higher than what has been offered by Sotoon.  This puts me in a position where I need to consider the financial aspects of my career move closely. I am reaching out to see if there might be flexibility in the terms of compensation and if there is room for negotiation to bring the offer closer to my current counter-offer.  It is not solely a financial decision, but ensuring equitable compensation is important to me.

I am ready to engage in further discussions and am inclined towards starting this new chapter with Sotoon, provided we can find common ground on my concerns. Please let me know a convenient time for you to discuss this further.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to our conversation.

Warm regards,
Mohammad
