rust+:
- fast and numerous optimizations
- no gc, but memory safe

- let a = [1,2,3,4]; // []int{1,2,3}
fn, i32, i64, f64 (minor issue I suppose)


for i in sth    // for _, i := range sth //  gemini answered
? why not in === " := range "
? also I would have prefered first value, then optional index instead
    then k,v for maps?
// go: why not str (like python) instead of string


go+
- faster compile time
- gc
- channels
- larger community / apps (all k8s cloud native)

- a := vs let a
- no need for : for type annotation
- no need for -> for return function type
- no ;

enum, option type,


go vs rust:
- shadowing!

a float64



var a str
str


func main() {
  var a string
}


fn main() {
  var a str
}
