" is the sign for register
:reg show all registers

e.g. : "kyy  or "kp  , that will use register k
and capital means append, e.g. "Ky means append to register k
if not specified then it is " register means : simple p is ""p

system registers are + for mouse and * for ctrl+c and etc

to check if vim can access system registers or not, check:

:echo has('clipboard') if it returns 0 so it has not, you have to
compile your vim with +clipboard option

making vim is ... you know :)

so just install vim-gtk


then map like vnoremap y "+y
note: don't use map cause it becomes recursively mapped and it haults.

don't do +y reg, if needed, do it like in terminal, select with mouse and then ctrl+c and ctrl+v , if needed to select multiple lines or the whole text, :set nonumber
