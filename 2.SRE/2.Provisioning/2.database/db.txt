D : IMDB/MMDB  (redis [with persistance] , memcache)  ,  mongodb: in memory storage engine
(C) [cap] vs EC:    Cassandra , riak , [mongo] single-master system and all reads go to the primary by default. If you optionally enable reading from the secondaries then MongoDB becomes eventually consistent where it's possible to read out-of-date results.
