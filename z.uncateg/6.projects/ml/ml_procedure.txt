data collection/generation
data analysis
data preperation:
	missing handling
	feature reduction : pca
	shuffle ##
	feature increasing : polynomial features
	data scaling : standardscaler, minmax , 

classifiers, regressors | with GridSearchCV , RandomizedSearchCV , a good model
ensembles: boot straping , Bagging: for high var, low bias



learning curve : bias , variance
validation curve:


sth is evident: always test<trian,
	but if test << train, increase sample size , if its not possible to increase that much so
	else if (test ==train): model saturated, if higher score needed, change model

random forrest , dummy classifier



decision tree and random forrest dont react to sccaling
