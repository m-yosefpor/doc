#share data train and test on each other data
#write both classifiers and regressors
#achieved 1.0 test score for linear regression
#y scaled and again 1.0 score
#achieved 0.85 test score for direct classification
#build a classifer with linear regressor, write a class myself
#achieved 0.997 test score with the new classifier
#checked the errors, it was for zero determinants, regressor estimated 10e-18 or so
#pickle export the regressor and new classifier
#histogram for x  , sigmaz?? not really rand_dm
#random generation of density matrix using qutip, using np.rand and NN^\dag
#random generation using a uniform selection of features in bloch sphere
#proposal
------------------------------
validation curves
learning curves
GridSearchCV , RandomizedSearchCV

removing each feature and calculate scores
add noise and calculate robustness


study entanglement : physical review recents, seprability criterion
prepare for a presentation
------------------------------
?add kernel, with only jomalate martabe 4

how to : randomized/grid searchCV + feature selction + cross validation


data analysis
tree feature importance
