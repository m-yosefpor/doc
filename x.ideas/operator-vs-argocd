operators:
- installation and upgrade (can be done with helm)
- monitoring & alerting (can be done with helm + pm-operator + gf-operator)
- full life cycle: backup, restore, for sts apps ... (operators only)
- k8s integration: self service multitenancy (authN & authZ, operators only)

note: reconcile is also supported in k8s.. if you argue sb might modify deployment, I say sb might modify the CR.. consider it as a templating tool and you see there is no difference
