kustomize, but not helm:
- support cusmization to any level, but in helm can not edit anything unless provided some vars for it.


helm, but not kustomize:
- for
- if
- programming (tpl calulating vars, arithmetics, etc)





helm and argocd drawbacks:
- values.yaml can not be templated, or at least a map.yaml to provide vars to dependency charts
- support cusmization to any level, but in helm can not edit anything unless provided some vars for it. -> argocd: kustomized-helm
 or post-hooks for manuals
- having vars as a.b.c.d instead of many indents
- many empty files (optional valueFiles). no option to ignore missing valuefiles:
     use value structs instead???? not possible for proxy charts
     ignore errors -> custom wrapper??
- secret management (hacky with sops), no multitenancy -> hacky wrapper
