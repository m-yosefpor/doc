argocd reencrypt route has issues


```
    mode tcp
    option httpchk GET /readyz
    http-check expect status 200
%{ for i, s in backend_ips ~}
    server master-${i} ${s}:6443 check inter 5s rise 2 fall 3 check-ssl verify none
    server master-${i} ${s}:6443 check
%{ endfor ~}

```


next step:
2. force craate new node with new ignition
3. force reboot node with new ignition


âˆš script should be rerun and nodes should be destroyed if failed in any step
node stuck when draining (pod delete)
multiple draining node takes time (pdb)
terraform/openstack dumb scheduling (if multiple nodes at one time)
where do I want to schedule it  + live-migrate takes time as it need labeling and other stuff


force igniton to run on next boot


Another app is currently holding the xtables lock


maxUnavailable field on the machine configuration pool and marks them as unavailable. By default, this value is set to 1 (use explicit)
