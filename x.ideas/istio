http rewrite, retry, fault-injection, add headers, circuit breakers, mirroring, cors policy
ratelimit, timeouts, weighted, path-match rules,
cons:

increased latency
more resources required
side-car throttling can impact performance -> monitoring/alerting
slower container initilization time
increased configuration complexity on user side

policies
HA Gateway
