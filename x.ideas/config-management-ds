ds on k8s which mounts files: https://github.com/thomastaylor312/advanced-helm-demos/tree/master/cluster-config

regsitries???

Only dropins which are not critical??


image:
  - k8s.grc.io/pause ??
  - bash with some idempotent script (pbr, etc) and   sleep 100000000? or while true sleep run ??


I think we can not mount ON the host, but only from the host. Esp how you want to mount CM? it is a volume itself.
duplicate mount path??? a hostpath and CM (I don't think it could work.)

something custom operator like MCO or node tuning??
