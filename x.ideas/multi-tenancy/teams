argocd whitelist quota in rbac

```
spec:
  clusterResourceWhitelist:
  - group: ""
    kind: Namespace
  description: Example Project
  destinations:
  - namespace: abar-internal
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  namespaceResourceBlacklist:
  - group: ""
    kind: ResourceQuota
  - group: ""
    kind: LimitRange
  - group: ""
    kind: PodMonitor
  roles:
  - description: Read-only privileges to my-project
    groups:
    - cloud_engineer_members
    name: read-only
    policies:
    - p, proj:my-project:read-only, applications, get, my-project/*, allow
  - description: Sync privileges for prometheus-operator
    name: ci-role
    policies:
    - p, proj:my-project:ci-role, applications, sync, my-project/prometheus-operator,
      allow
  sourceRepos:
  - '*'
```


design:
- every project has a very small mount of quota by default, if sb needs a quota increase, they should join a team

join a project to a team:

- If team does not already exists, create a clusterresourcequota with a $TEAM name in helm if not exists (separate repo with MR?)

- add the project to the team after approval of the team owner for the new project (service desk? CRD?) quota of the projects is counted towards the team quota. You can view the amount of quota and used with `oc get appliedclusterresourcequota -oyaml` (shouldn't we have it in other ways to obfuscate it?)
```
NS="smapp-routing"
TEAM="smapp"
oc label ns $NS snappcloud.io/team=$TEAM
```


user-docs:

Ask in cloud support to add the new project to a team (requirs team lead approval). Quota of the projects is counted towards the team quota. You can view the amount of team quota used with `oc describe appliedclusterresourcequota`

You can edit quota for a project your self after joining a team with `oc edit quota`






- having grafana dashboards for each team to see what projects use the most resources.
- having routes overview, etc dashboards with namespace selector.
- rbac of this dashboards can come from a team CRD.
- grafana can be integrated with snappcloud gitops-operator
