BM issues: reboot time

In BM maintenance, we can not relocate masters if they are BMs

Staging? we can not easily have multiple staging..  for openstack the number of changes are low, only 1 suffice (office),
but for OKD, we need many (~3) stagings!

low isolation: load avg, cpu usage, highly affect other pods
bugs: node not hangs, have to reboot


pod per node:
    work:
        kubelet configs: max pod
        node cidr:
    performance:
        kubelet parameters:
        - burst
        - qos
        daemonset reources: (two sets)


machine config pools:
    openstack specific:
        nodeip-configuration.service
        other machine configs
        no dhcp for routes:
        - pbr
        - routes
        - bonding, ip
    no separate mcp pool possible:
    no ops metal3 for bmo:
    - self metal3
    enabling mahcine autoscaling:

node tuning pools: possible
firewall rules instead of openstack sg:
    no nftables yet: custom fcos image


schduler:
- tuning
- csi storage Storage Capacity Constraints -> upgrade 1.21, rebase our forks
