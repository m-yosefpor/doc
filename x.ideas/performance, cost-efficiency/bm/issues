BM issues:
    reboot time:
        bugs: node not hangs, have to reboot
        changes:
            mcp:
                upgrades
            kargs:
        solutions:
        - disable interfaces for faster boot
        - disable bond1?
        - use ssd for sda
        - anything for HP??





build?

masters:
    - In BM maintenance, we can not relocate masters if they are BMs
    + etcd volume on ceph is painful. It's more of a Volume problem than storage

- Staging? we can not easily have multiple staging..  for openstack the number of changes are low, only 1 suffice (office),
but for OKD, we need many (~3) stagings!

edge: low isolation: load avg, cpu usage, highly affect other pods, also we can not give a BM all to an edge



pod per node:
    work:
        kubelet configs: max pod
        node cidr:
    performance:
        kubelet parameters:
        - burst
        - qos
        daemonset reources: (two sets)


machine config pools:
    openstack specific:
        nodeip-configuration.service
        other machine configs
        no dhcp for routes:
        - pbr
        - routes
        - bonding, ip
    no separate mcp pool possible:
    no ops metal3 for bmo:
    - self metal3
    enabling mahcine autoscaling:

node tuning pools: possible
firewall rules instead of openstack sg:
    no nftables yet: custom fcos image


schduler:
- tuning
- csi storage Storage Capacity Constraints -> upgrade 1.21, rebase our forks
