Issue: Linphone Client Registration Failed.

Client Info:
  Device: SM-T805
  Android Version: "6.0.1"
  SIP Client: Linphone v 4.1
  Configs:
    Username: yosefpor
    Password: yosefpor
    Domain: sinaimscore.lo
    Transport: UDP
    Proxy: <sip:ims.sinaimscore.ir;transport=udp>
    Outbound proxy: ON
		
Explanation: |
  Used tcpdump to capture the SIP packets between Client and P-CSCF
  ------
  Client sends "REGISTER" to P-CSCF : (Without Digest Authentication)
  P-CSCF sends "401 Unauthorized - Challenging the UE"
  Client sends "REGISTER" to P-CSCF : (Including Digest Authentication)
  P-CSCF sends "100 Trying" to Client
  P-CSCF sends "403 Authentication Failed"
  ------
  Registration was successful with the same configurations with Linphone on Windows, Linphone on ios, and Boghe on windows
  
Status: Solved

How Resolved: Updated Linphone version to v4.1.1
